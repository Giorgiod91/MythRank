# MythRank: A Performance-Based Ranking System for WoW Mythic+ Players

- MythRank is an innovative ranking system designed to enhance the competitive landscape of World of Warcraft's Mythic+ dungeons. Unlike existing ranking systems like Raider.IO, which only consider the highest timed keys completed by a player, MythRank   
  evaluates individual performance during dungeons, offering a more detailed and data-driven approach.


# What Sets MythRank Apart

- Damage output (DPS)
- Interrupt usage
- Crowd control(CC) effectivness
- Defensuve cooldown usage
- potion usage
- Deaths and avoidable damage taken

- These performance factors are weighted and combined to create a comprehensive score that truly reflects the player's contribution to the run. This means that even if a player does not have the highest dungeon clear, they can still rank highly based on their individual performance.

# The Problem solving
- While Raider.IO provides valuable insight into the highest and fastest dungeon clears, it does not reflect how well players performed during those runs. For example, a player could complete a dungeon at a fast pace, but without contributing much in terms of 
  D    interrupts, or crowd control. MythRank solves this by giving players the credit they deserve for their contributions beyond just completing the dungeon.

# Data-Driven Insights:
- MythRank provides detailed metrics for DPS, interrupts, CC, and other key performance indicators, giving players and guilds valuable insights into areas where improvement can be made.
