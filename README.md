# MythRank: A Performance-Based Ranking System for WoW Mythic+ Players

MythRank is an innovative ranking system designed to enhance the competitive landscape of World of Warcraft's Mythic+ dungeons. Unlike existing ranking systems like Raider.IO, which only consider the highest timed keys completed by a player, MythRank evaluates individual performance during dungeons, offering a more detailed and data-driven approach. **Powered by Machine Learning**.

## What Sets MythRank Apart

- **Damage output (DPS)**
- **Interrupt usage**
- **Crowd control (CC) effectiveness**
- **Defensive cooldown usage**
- **Potion usage**
- **Deaths and avoidable damage taken**

These performance factors are weighted and combined to create a comprehensive score that truly reflects the player's contribution to the run. This means that even if a player does not have the highest dungeon clear, they can still rank highly based on their individual performance.

## Predictive Performance Using Machine Learning (coming soon)

- MythRank leverages **machine learning** algorithms to **predict** whether a player’s DPS (or other metrics) will be on the higher end for an upcoming dungeon run based on historical data and raid logs.
- **Limited Data?** No problem! If there isn’t enough personal performance data for a player, MythRank can pull in data from past raid logs (e.g., Warcraft Logs) and use that to make predictions about the player’s likely performance.
- By analyzing patterns from previous dungeons and raid logs, the system can predict performance trends and provide **more accurate rankings** even with limited or incomplete data.
  
Machine learning helps MythRank not only evaluate current player performance but also anticipate future outcomes based on the data available, making it a **more intelligent and dynamic ranking system**.

## The Problem We're Solving

While Raider.IO provides valuable insight into the highest and fastest dungeon clears, it does **not** reflect how well players performed during those runs. For example, a player could complete a dungeon at a fast pace, but without contributing much in terms of DPS, interrupts, or crowd control. MythRank solves this by giving players the credit they deserve for their contributions beyond just completing the dungeon.

## Data-Driven Insights:

MythRank provides detailed metrics for DPS, interrupts, CC, and other key performance indicators, giving players and guilds valuable insights into areas where improvement can be made. With **machine learning**, we are able to predict performance trends and improve the overall ranking accuracy for both individual players and teams.

## Conclusion

MythRank aims to provide a more **accurate, fair, and performance-driven ranking system** for Mythic+ players. By focusing on individual contributions rather than just completed dungeon times and incorporating **predictive analytics**, MythRank ensures that players are ranked based on their **true performance potential**.
